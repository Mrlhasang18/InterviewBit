Q)The following code is supposed to rotate the array A by B positions.

So, for example,


A : [1 2 3 4 5 6]
B : 1

The output :

[2 3 4 5 6 1]
However, there is a small bug in the problem. Fix the bug and submit the problem.


soln:
vector<int> Solution::rotateArray(vector<int> &A, int B) {
	vector<int> ret; 
	for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
		ret.push_back(A[(i + B)%A.size()]);
	}
	return ret; 
}

explanation:


The given code defines a function rotateArray that takes a vector of integers A and an integer B as parameters.
The function rotates the elements of the input vector to the right by a specified number of positions (B). 
The rotation is performed using a simple modulo operation to handle cases where the rotation count exceeds the
length of the vector.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Function Signature:

vector<int> Solution::rotateArray(vector<int> &A, int B)

The function rotateArray takes a reference to a vector of integers A and an integer B representing the number of 
positions to rotate.
Initialization:

vector<int> ret;
A new vector ret is declared to store the rotated elements.
Rotation Loop:

for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    ret.push_back(A[(i + B) % A.size()]);
}

The loop iterates through each element of the original vector A.
For each element at index i, it calculates the new index using (i + B) % A.size(). 
The % A.size() ensures that the index wraps around to the beginning if it exceeds the size of the vector.
The element at the newly calculated index is pushed to the ret vector.
Return:

return ret;

The rotated vector ret is returned.
Example:
Suppose A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and B = 2. Calling rotateArray(A, B) would result in the vector [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. 
Each element is shifted to the right by 2 positions.

Keep in mind that this implementation rotates the elements to the right. If you need left rotation, you can
modify the formula to (i + A.size() - B) % A.size()
