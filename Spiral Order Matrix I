code:

vector<int> Solution::spiralOrder(const vector<vector<int>>& A) {
int m = A.size();
int n = A[0].size();
vector<int> ans;

int rs = 0, cs = 0;
int re = m - 1;
int ce = n - 1;

while (rs <= re && cs <= ce) {
// Traverse right
for (int i = cs; i <= ce; i++) {
ans.push_back(A[rs][i]);
}
rs++;

// Traverse down
for (int i = rs; i <= re; i++) {
ans.push_back(A[i][ce]);
}
ce--;

if (rs <= re) {
// Traverse left
for (int i = ce; i >= cs; i--) {
ans.push_back(A[re][i]);
}
re--;
}

if (cs <= ce) {
// Traverse up
for (int i = re; i >= rs; i--) {
ans.push_back(A[i][cs]);
}
cs++;
}
}

return ans;
}

explanation:
It implements a function named spiralOrder that takes a 2D vector (matrix) A as input and returns a 1D vector representing the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
The idea is to traverse the matrix in a spiral fashion, starting from the top-left corner and moving right, down, left, and up, in a cycle until all elements are 
visited.

Let's break down the code:
The four loops inside the while loop correspond to moving right, down, left, and up, respectively. The rs, cs, re, and ce variables keep track of the
boundaries of the current spiral layer. The while loop continues until the boundaries meet or cross each other, ensuring that all elements are visited 
in the correct order.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n), where 'm' is the number of rows and 'n' is the number of columns in the matrix.
